# Dear Today Me

> _‚ÄúNothing is good except what leads to fairness, self-control, courage, and free will. And nothing bad except what does the opposite.‚Äù ‚Äî Marcus Aurelius_

## About

This repo maintains a letter to my present self from Better Me. The ideas in the letter represent my core values and the person I want to be. I strive to live by them every single day. Like the North Star, they guide me through the noise and chaos of life, so I can [center my thoughts and actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_in_60_rule) when I feel lost.

## Tools

To help you use the letter in your daily life. I built the following tools:
